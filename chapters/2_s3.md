# Simple Storage Service (S3)

- S3 is object-based storage, it allows you to store files (up to 5TB) in buckets.
- S3 bucket has a universal namespace. Each bucket name has to be unqiue in its availablity zone (AZ).
- S3 returns HTTP code `200` if file is uploaded sucessfully.
- Each object stored in S3 consists of
	- Key (i.e., file name)
	- Value (i.e., file content)
	- Version ID
	- Metadata
	- Access control list (ACL)
	- Torrent
- S3 ensures **read-after-write consistency** for `POST` requests, while it only guarantees **eventual consistency** for `PUT` and `DELETE` requests.
