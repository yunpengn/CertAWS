# Simple Storage Service (S3)

- S3 is object-based storage, it allows you to store files (up to 5TB) in buckets.
- S3 bucket has a **universal namespace**. Each bucket name has to be unqiue in its availablity zone (AZ).
- S3 returns HTTP code `200` if file is uploaded sucessfully.
- Each object stored in S3 consists of
	- Key (i.e., file name)
	- Value (i.e., file content)
	- Version ID
	- Metadata
	- Access control list (ACL)
	- Torrent
- S3 ensures **read-after-write consistency** for `POST` requests (i.e., to add new files although AWS calls them new `PUT`s), while it only guarantees **eventual consistency** for `PUT` and `DELETE` requests.
	- If you use cross-region replication for your S3 buckets, the changes may not be reflected until the operation is fully propagated to all replicas.
- It is possible to enable MFA for `DELETE` requests.
- It is also possible to turn on _server access logging_.
	- The log can be sent to another bucket belonging to the same or a different account.

## S3 Tiering

There are different tiers of S3 buckets and the comparison between them is presented in the table below:

## Security & Encryption

- Access control to an S3 bucket can be managed using either a bucket ACL or a bucket policy.
- By default, all newly created buckets are _private_.
- There are 3 approaches to achieve encryption for your interaction with S3 buckets:
	- **Encryption in transit:** using SSL/TLS (or HTTPS);
	- **Server-side encryption (encryption at rest):** the key could be from
		- S3 managed keys (also known as _SSE-S3_); or
		- AWS key management service (also known as _SSE-KMS_); or
		- Customer provided keys (also known as _SSE-C_);
	- **Client-side encryption:** the data would be encrypted before sent out.

## Versioning & Lifecycle

- Using **versioning** with S3 could be used to backup data (similar to any VCS).
	- It stores all versions of an object (all writes + delete marker).
- Once _enabled_, versioning cannot be _disabled_. It can only be _suspended_.
- Versioning can be integrated to lifecycle rules to optimize the size of the data stored.
	- Similar to the eviction policy (such as LFU or LRU) for Redis cache.
- MFA delete can only be used when versioning is enabled.
	- If a bucket's versioning configuration is MFA Deleteâ€“enabled, the bucket owner must include the `x-amz-mfa` header in requests to permanently delete an object version or change the versioning state of the bucket;
	- All authorized IAM users can enable versioning, but only the bucket owner can enable MFA Delete.
- **Lifecycle** automates moving your objects between different storage classes.
	- It can be used in conjuction with versioning;
	- It can be applied to current version and/or previous versions.

## Replication & Acceleration

- If you turn on **cross-region replication**, changes to objects in one bucket will be automatically propagated to another bucket for faster retrieval & disaster recovery purposes.
	- Replication can be done for the whole bucket or object-based with certain prefixes or tags only;
	- Versioning must be enabled on both _source bucket_ and _destination bucket_;
	- Files which are existing in a bucket when replication is turned on are not replicated automatically. However, subsequent updates to these files would be replicated;
	- Delete markers are not replicated;
	- Deletion of individual versions or delete markers (manually) would not be replicated.
- **Transfer acceleration** takes advantage of _CloudFront_. Data arrived at edge locations will be routed to S3 over an optimized network path.
