# Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)

- AWS **Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)** is a web service which provides resizable compute capacity.
- EC2 pricing model:
    - **On demand:** experiments, short-term workloads that cannot be interrupted;
    - **Reserved:** applications with steady state or predictable usage;
        - Standard reserved instances, convertible reserved instances, scheduled reserved instances.
    - **Spot:** applications that have flexible start & end times;
    - **Dedicated hosts:** applications with regulatory requirements.
- To avoid terminating a EC2 instance by mistake, you can turn on _termination protection_ (by default, it is not turned on).
- On an EBS-backed EC2 instance, the root EBS will be deleted by default when the instance is terminated.
- When using the default AMI, the root EBS volume cannot be encrypted.
    - You can use a 3rd-party tool to encrypt it (such as bit locker);
    - You can also create your AMI using AWS console or CLI to encrypt it.
- Additional EBS volumes can always be encrypted if needed.
